# CodeGPT Interface

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Testing Versions
**Node.js**: v20.11.0\
**npm**: 10.8.2\
The project has been known to be buggy on older versions of Node.js.

## Available Scripts
Before running the server, make sure your OpenAI key is set in the .env file.

In the server directory, run:
### `npm install`

Then run:
### `node index.js`

to start the server. Make sure port 3000 is available for now as the server defaults to it, but you can also set your own port in the .env file.

In the client directory, after starting the server, you can run:
### `npm install`
and then run:
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
